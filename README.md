okay. okay. where to start? just wobbled outta Nonnas — wow. i mean, like, a tidal wave of a film, right? the screen was this ocean of... emotions???, and i was caught somewhere in its undertow, i think. you know when the floor's sticky with soda and popcorn's in your shoe and somehow it all makes more sense in that gelatinous shadowland of theater seats. what was that smell? butter or... memory.

the beginning was, uh, like waiting for a storm, or maybe like the smell of rain on hot asphalt? everyone on edge, clouds palpable but nothing's falling. and that old kitchen they kept showing, i swear it smelled like my grandma's on sundays. i could almost taste the tomatoes, or was that just popcorn? nah, spaghetti, i'm sure. 

you could feel the audience tense up when that one scene hit — the sounds! so crisp, like biting into an apple you thought was a peach. can't even recall the dialogue, just, whoosh, the feeling of it. maybe i was buzzing too loud in my own head, you'd think i was at a bee convention... yeah, maybe i need to download the movie and listen again somewhere quieter. 

> was the protagonist named after a flatbread? or maybe a rare cloud formation? i don’t know, what does that say about archetypes? the grandmother’s eyes were like melting glaciers, slow but inevitable, relentless with something unsaid. her voice sounded like the weather channel at 3 AM when the anchor’s so tired they start morphing into your dreams about soup storms or sudden lasagna-rain. totally makes sense. 

and oh! when they cut to that scene in the garden? man, like watching spring arrive in a single frame. flowers blooming in reverse? i think. my brain felt like pudding at that point, and who knows what the garden really looked like. but, yeah, watch the movie to figure that mish-mash out. 

so much emotion. kinda like a thunderstorm you get to watch from the window without getting soaked, you know? the whole thing felt like a guided tour of someone’s meteorological family history. 

back sore like i've been uprooted from a tree. maybe that's where they hide these emotions, between the vertebrae. and shoulders tight, like a low-pressure system settling in. was that the film or my seat? have to go paper that one down later... huh, or maybe nap.

oh and my shoes are still full of popcorn. call it trail snacks for the trip home, or lie to myself that i’ll eat healthier next time, next year, next lifetime or something.

print(what even was that ending, though?)
for cloud in nonnas:
   movie.feels() == confusion.browser()

all right, that's it from chaotic headspace-central. over and out.
